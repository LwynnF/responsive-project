					<h1>Then.</h1>
					<p>
						Prior to my coding and SheCodes journey, I was working in the
						finance sector and after three years, I knew it was time for a new
						challenge. I have always had an interest in tech and loved problem
						solving from a young age, whether this be in the form of sudokus or
						playing Professor Layton on my Nintendo DS. <br />
						One day on Instagram, I started to notice ads for SheCodes and I
						decided to join the SheCodes Express live coding class. It amazed me
						how quickly I could see the result of the code and that coding is
						not as scary as it seems. After that class, I signed myself up for
						the SheCodes Basics course and the rest is history!
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Now -->
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<h1 class="text-end">Now.</h1>
						<p class="text-end">
							After completing the SheCodes Basics course, I felt that I had
							finally found a new passion and loved the satisfaction from
							solving coding errors. As of right now, I am currently
							participating in the SheCodes Pro workshop - creating this
							portfolio as part of my SheCodes Responsive final project.
							<br />
							I find that coding is best learnt through practice and ny
							participating in the SheCodes challenges I am able to put my newly
							acquired skills and knowledge into practice and have fun along the
							way.
						</p>
					</div>

				<!-- Next -->
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<h1>Next.</h1>
						<p>
							Upon completion of the workshops and having upskilled - learning
							CSS, HTML, Javascript, React and more technologies, I hope I am
							equipped with the skills to break into the tech industry.
							<br />
							I chose to transition from finance to tech as I love the freedom
							for creativity, the rewarding satisfaction from cracking coding
							issues but most importantly I wanted to pursue a new career where
							typically women are underpresented and to help bridge the gender
							gap in tech.
